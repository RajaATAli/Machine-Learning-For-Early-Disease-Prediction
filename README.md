# Machine Learning for Early Disease Diabetes Prediction (UROP Research Project)

This repository contains all the research materials and code for the UROP project titled "Machine Learning for Early Disease Prediction: A Case Study on Diabetes", mentored by Dr. Angela P. Murillo.

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions globally. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on clinical symptoms and laboratory tests, which might not suffice for early-stage risk detection. This project aims to harness various machine learning models to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and other relevant health data. The endeavor encompasses data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and further insights derived from the data.
