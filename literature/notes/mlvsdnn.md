# Summary of Research Paper - Machine learning and deep learning predictive models for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review
https://doi.org/10.1186/s13098-021-00767-9

## Methodologies
- The review used PRISMA methodology, enhanced with guidelines from Keele and Durham Universities.
- 90 studies were analyzed, focusing on model types, datasets, and performance metrics.
- Machine learning models evaluated included Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT), Logistic Regression (LR), and others.

## Datasets
- Datasets varied widely in features used, size, and complexity.
- They included sociodemographic, lifestyle, clinical diagnosis, and laboratory test results.
- Some models used large datasets (e.g., over 70,000 samples), particularly for DNNs.

## Main Findings
- Tree-based algorithms (like RF and DT) had top performances, but required data balancing and feature selection.
- DNNs were less optimal but capable of handling large and complex datasets.
- Data balancing and feature selection improved model efficiency.
- Models trained on tidy datasets achieved near-perfect performance.

## Gaps
- Significant heterogeneity in study methodologies, making comparisons challenging.
- Lack of transparency in feature selection.
- Disparity in validation metrics used, hindering comparative analysis.


## Potential Research Questions
- What are effective ways to standardize validation metrics across different studies?
- Can the performance of DNNs in handling large diabetes datasets be further optimized?
- What are the specific strengths and weaknesses of traditional ML models compared to DL models in predicting type 2 diabetes, considering different dataset sizes and complexities?
- How do feature selection processes differ between ML and DL models in diabetes prediction, and what impact does this have on the interpretability of these models?
- Can DL models be effectively optimized to perform as well as traditional ML models on smaller and less complex datasets typically used in diabetes prediction?
- Are there hybrid approaches that effectively combine the advantages of both ML and DL for improved predictive performance in type 2 diabetes? (**Hybrid Modelling Approach**)
- What is the comparative impact of different data preprocessing techniques on the performance of ML versus DL models in diabetes prediction?
How do ML and DL models compare in handling longitudinal data for predicting the progression of type 2 diabetes?
