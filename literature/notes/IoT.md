# Summary of Research Paper - Early Detection of Prediabetes and T2DM Using Wearable Sensors and Internet-of-Things-Based Monitoring Applications
https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1719043

- The paper emphasizes the growing global challenge of managing prediabetes and T2DM. These conditions significantly impact healthcare systems and budgets.
- Early detection through continuous monitoring using wearable devices and IoT applications is proposed as a vital strategy for managing these conditions.
- **Objective:** The study aims to develop an AI model using wearable technology and IoT applications for early detection of prediabetes and T2DM.

## Methods
- An artificial intelligence model using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference was developed. It considered factors like heart rate, breathing rate, activity data, blood glucose, height, weight, age, and sex.
- Data was gathered using a wearable body vest (Hexoskin) and manual recordings.
- The study followed four phases â€“ observation, theory building, experimentation, and systems development.

## Results
-  The model achieved a 91% overall agreement in Kappa analysis.
- A 2-year follow-up showed improved diabetic profiles for participants using the model compared to traditional methods.

## Potential Gaps
- Reliance on a specific wearable device (Hexoskin) might raise questions about the model's applicability with other devices or in different settings.
- The research highlights the challenge of data sharing across platforms, which is crucial for the widespread adoption of such systems in healthcare.
- The model primarily focuses on physiological and activity-related data. Incorporating broader health determinants, including mental health, dietary patterns, and socio-environmental factors, could enhance its predictive accuracy and relevance.

## Potential Research Questions
- How can the model integrate broader health determinants? (mental health, nutrition, and social determinants)
- How can data interoperability challenges be addressed?
